1) What has been your experience learning bash?
It was a very slow start and I don't feel like this class is a great intro to the language.

2) What would have made the experience with learning it better, if there were problems with it, my instructions, or the assignments?
This course felt like the students were supposed to already have experience in bash or another similar language.
This however is not necessariloy the case however, as Computer Science students need to take this class as their first official interaction with anything in the terminal.
Spending more time at the start of the course learning basic commands and the addons for those commands, such as "sort -u" for unique outputs (this is one we did learn in class).

3) Approximately how much time did you spend working on assignments?
I spent anywhere between 4-8 hours on each assignment.

4) Are you able to see how the programs used in this class or learning bash would be helpful for your career?
Yes, automation is very helpful in the working world, and I can see how the scripts we did in this class could be applied outside of the course.
